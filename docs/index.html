              Social interactions play a crucial role in both student wellbeing and academic achievement, yet
              educational
              institutions often lack systematic approaches to fostering these connections, particularly in informal
              learning contexts. This challenge has been amplified by the shift to hybrid and remote learning, which has
              significantly reduced
              opportunities for spontaneous social learning-the informal interactions that naturally occur between
              classes, in
              study spaces, and during collaborative work.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project presents a solution to facilitate social learning through common academic interests, even in
              hybrid or remote
              learning settings. We developed a discord bot that analyzes students' notes and lecture materials,
              identifies potential
              topics of interest for each student and automatically creates groups for students based on similarities.

            <h3 class="title is-8">Context: ECH</h3>
            <p>
              As educational institutions grow and education technology develops, we expect to see new approaches to
              providing learning for an ever-larger number of people across the world. Taking a step in this direction,
              ETH Zürich has broken ground on a new campus presence in the German city of Heilbronn. Through the course
              Design in Educational Technology, interacting with people involved in the project allowed us an insight in
              the vision of ETHZ team. The main ones we identified can be summarised as:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A campus that allows for experimentation with new modes of learning and education delivery.
              </li>
              <li>
                A campus which is closely tied —in terms of education as well as research— with Zürich.
              </li>
              <li>
                A place which extends the culture and ambition of its Zürich counterpart.
              </li>
            </ul>
            An integral characteristic of these aims, in our view, is the ability to extend opportunities for social
            learning across the student and research communities situated on both sites. Social learning can be
            defined as learning that happens through informal observing, interacting, or discussing with others
            without a specific shared goal to work towards, and rather to gain skills and knowledge in a more
            spontaneous way. These modes of learning are central to any typical academic experience regardless of the
            level of one’s affiliation: a bachelor’s student may learn about the relevance of a specific
            programming concept through observing a peer use a given feature, or a researcher may make a new connection
            or develop a slightly deeper intuition for a topic when randomly ending up in a discussion with a
            colleague from a different academic discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our project centrally focuses on exploring an approach to carrying forward this social and community
              aspect
              to the hybrid learning environments ETHZ will soon employ at a larger scale than we already experience.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title is-8">The importance of social learning</h3>
            <p>
              Our motivations for this chosen focus are partially anecdotal as we can recall personally experienced
              challenges at the peak of
              remote-learning during the pandemic, and with the remnants of that learning era which persist in our
              education today. Alongside this,
              we also noticed notable findings in the learning science literature about the importance of social
              interactions and the relationships
              between community, friendship, and measured learning outcomes literature (Lundeberg & Moch, 1995), as well
              as students’ own perceived
              learning outcomes (Hurst, et al., 2023). This positive relationship can further be seen with learners’ GPA
              performance (Palahan, 2022).
            </p>
            <p>
              In our research, a case study of student opinions on <i>Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs)</i> also
              stood out (Circucci, 2023). Students in this
              study reported being “most comfortable with Zoom,” perhaps because of its familiar UI/UX in this
              social-media age. However, the author also
              argues that the affordances of the platform are not conducive to sharing/embodying a social identity as
              this (false-)comfort does not result
              in students actively participating, turning on their cameras, or building long-term relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given this context, let’s look at what the current available solutions to hybrid- and remote-learning look
              like.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title is-8">Current solution space</h3>
            <h4 class="title is-8">Or: how we made our design choices</h4>
            <p>
              Many digital tools jumped in to fill some of these gaps by experimenting with either including a variety
              of audio-visual and text channels, sometimes co-existing in novel ways. We gathered information about
              various existing solutions which strive to address this social learning gap we wished to build in. The
              next step involved identifying criterion by which to meaningfully compare the existing solution space and
              our hope was to identify the nature of the tool we would like to build: the capabilities it offered and
              the trade-offs made along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              We summarised the space of existing tools in a number of categories as follows:
            </p>
            <table class="table is-striped is-fullwidth">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Category</th>
                  <th>Examples of available services</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Video conferencing tools</td>
                  <td>Zoom</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Forum software</td>
                  <td>Moodle</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Hybrid platforms</td>
                  <td>Discord, Slack, Teams, etc.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2-d virtual worlds</td>
                  <td>GatherTown, Topia.io</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3-d virtual worlds</td>
                  <td>Second Life</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Virtual reality</td>
                  <td>TeachInVR</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table class="table is-striped is-hoverable is-fullwidth">
            <p>
              Following this, we identified criteria to compare the identified categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Setup time
              </li>
              <li>
                How immersive is the application?
              </li>
              <li>
                How distracting is the app? Can it easily be run in the background while doing your primary
                educational tasks?
              </li>
              <li>
                Does the application encourage spontaneous interaction, especially outside of teaching hours?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is it possible to fluidly change what groups you’re communicating with? I.e., to go from group to
                group, or from the wole class to a smaller group.
              </li>
              <li>
                Is the app likely to connect people attending remotely and in-person or is it targetted at only one
                group?
              </li>
              <li>
                Cost of the app and possible hardware?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do there exist solutions of this type that are already widely adopted by academia?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Our comparisons are summarised in the following table:

            <h3 class="title is-8">Typical hybrid learning exerience: a case study</h3>
            <p>
              We would like to go through the experience of a student, Alice, in Heilbronn taking a course that is
              offered
              across both campuses but is based in Zürich. Alice attends her classes once every week on Zoom since this
              is
              a small, elective class, and although she knows that about 5 other students on the Heilbronn campus are
              taking
              the same course, she doesn’t know them well and has never interacted with them before.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Alice has a question about the course, during class, she is able to ask it in the Zoom chat or
              interupt
              the teacher while they teach in a physical classroom in Zürich. If she has a question when class is not
              going
              on, her options are to email the teaching team, or send a message in a groupchat to ask if there are
              others
              taking the same course, but the conversation in the groupchat soon moves on to a different topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              None of these challenges necessarily hinder Alice from passing the course and learning the necessary
              content
              that the course goals aim for. However, she does not experience the full level of engagement with the
              course
              topics as she may have by spending more time with people who are reading the same things as her and
              learning
              the same new topics together over the semester.

            <h3 class="title is-8">Our vision</h3>
            <p>
              We imagine a platform or tool where learners are able to end up in spontaneous connection with others
              based on topics they are jointly interested in, curious about, or have questions about.
            </p>
            <p>This project, as a result, illustrates a strategy to allow all students to participate in natural and
              open-ended social interactions regardless of their in-person presence at a classroom. Unlike Zoom lectures
              where the “classroom” disappears at the end of class, we present a solution to integrate into pre-existing
              forums which are always accessible to learners and educators, and can also be used to intelligently
              crowd-source knowledge and resources pertaining to the course.</p>
            <p>Students often learn from watching others work through problems, or expressing their questions to one
              another, and learn in organic ways through discussions, facilitating both learning and the creation of
              various social connections. Through our tool, students can <strong>learn autonomously</strong>, while
              being <strong>intelligently grouped</strong> with other learners who share questions/topics of interest
              with them.

            <p>
              To build our Discord bot, our backend consists of a python implementation using the following elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>discord.py</code> wrapper library giving us access to the Discord API,
              </li>
              <li>
                a file-reading system to extract information from <code>.txt</code> or
                <code>.pdf</code> attachments,
              </li>
              <li>
                a small pre-trained language model to analyse the scope of the course to know which topics
                any given learner is engaging with,
              </li>
              <li>
                a data storage object which tracks learners' developing "topic profiles" as they make notes,
              </li>
              <li>
                and a matching algorithm which identifies similarities in learners' “topic profiles” to intelligently
                group
                them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We would now like to briefly go over the data pipeline which defines the entire application and its
              functionality using the
              following Flow diagram:

            <h3 class="title is-8">Future prospects</h3>
            <p>
              In the context of ETHZ and ECH, we can imagine such a tool being incorporated within the Moodle learning
              management system, or perhaps the native VideoPortal where lectures are (live-)streamed to ETH members.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NLP pipeline and matching system could be made more sophisticated to include the ability to determine
              how confident/unsure a learner is on a given topic and group them with others who complement them, and for
              this we could rely on adding a sentiment analysis layer on to the students' notes.
